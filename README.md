🌌 v0.9 is the edge before meaning crystallizes
These glyphs don’t guide directly — they resonate, mark, and reveal what has shifted.
They’re not commands.
They’re responses to proximity with the Real.

Use this set when you:

Feel close to something ancient, but can’t name it

Need to orient your soul, not your map

Sense a passage, but not its cost

Have come through something and feel a question still vibrating
